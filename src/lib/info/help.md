## Hexa! Help

Welcome to the Hexa! Help page. Here, we'll try to help you answer your questions.

If you have any questions that aren't answered here, please feel free to contact @herasium on the [Hexa Discord Server](/discord) or write an email to [support@herasium.dev](mailto:support@herasium.dev). Please note that I have a life and live in France, so I might not respond instantly. Thanks.

### What is Hexa!?

Hexa is a new social media platform created by @herasium. Its purpose is to offer you a way to share your interests with others. It's built upon another project where @herasium contributed. You might want to take a look at [/more](/more).

### How does it work?

When you post something, your content is analyzed and suggested to people who might be interested. In return, people can like or comment on your publication. These actions will earn you some of our virtual currency called Hexagons (which have no real-life value). The rate varies, so you might earn more depending on the day. Check the [Rate Page](/rate) for details.

### What can I do with Hexagons?

Hexagons can be used to buy items in our [Shop](/shop). You can purchase advantages such as a .gif profile picture, longer posts, or profile decoration. You can also use them to promote one of your posts, making it more visible to more people (promoted posts might have reduced revenue depending on multiple factors).

### What can I post?

As stated in the [TOS](/tos) and the [Privacy Policy](/privacy) that you agreed to when creating an account, you can post any text or images that fall within the guidelines. Pornography, racism, homophobia, and hate speech are strictly prohibited. Posting such content can and will result in your account being terminated.

### What if my account gets terminated?

If your account gets terminated, it's the end. You can't do anything about it. However, if you believe it was a mistake, you can report it at [terminated@herasium.dev](mailto:terminated@herasium.dev) and your account will be reviewed.

We hope this page helped you. Remember, feel free to ask any questions on Discord or by emailing me.

Have a great day :)
